    <h1>GeoLead ⇄ GeoGuessr Bridge – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: {{ last_updated }}</p>

    <p>
      This browser extension (“Extension”) is provided by <strong>GeoLead</strong> (“we”, “us”).
      Its only purpose is to help you transfer your own GeoGuessr daily game results into your
      GeoLead account so that you don’t need to enter scores manually.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What the extension does</h2>
    <p>The Extension works in three simple steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        On <strong>geoguessr.com</strong>, it reads the game result data that is already available
        in the page (for example from GeoGuessr’s own JavaScript data) after you play a game.
      </li>
      <li>
        It stores a small summary of your latest game in the browser’s local extension storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the <strong>GeoLead</strong> submit page (<code>geolead.fun</code>), when you click
        “Import today’s game results”, it sends that summary to the GeoLead backend so that a
        score entry can be created or updated for you.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Extension does not run on any websites other than <code>geoguessr.com</code> and
      <code>geolead.fun</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data we access</h2>
    <p>From GeoGuessr pages we may access the following data for the game you just played:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>GeoGuessr profile information</strong> – such as your nickname, internal user
        ID and (if provided by GeoGuessr) email address.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Game metadata</strong> – such as game or daily quiz ID, game mode and
        date/time played.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Game results</strong> – scores per round, total score, round distances and
        coordinates for your guess and the correct location.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is read only for your own game and only for the purpose described here.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How we use the data</h2>
    <p>The Extension uses this data only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        store your latest game summary in <code>chrome.storage.local</code> in your browser so it
        can be transferred between GeoGuessr and GeoLead; and
      </li>
      <li>
        send the summary to the GeoLead backend when you click
        “Import today’s game results”, so that GeoLead can create or update your score entry and
        display your scores, distances and maps.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> use this data for advertising, profiling, or analytics that are
      unrelated to GeoLead.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data sharing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Extension sends your game summary only to the GeoLead service that you use
        (for example <code>https://www.geolead.fun/</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell or transfer your data to third parties.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use your data to determine creditworthiness or for lending.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the browser, the game summary is stored in the Extension’s local storage and is
        overwritten the next time you play a game and the Extension captures new results.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the GeoLead side, your imported scores are stored only as long as needed to provide your
        leaderboard and history features. Retention is governed by GeoLead’s main site privacy
        policy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The Extension uses the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><code>storage</code></strong> – to temporarily store the latest game summary
        between <code>geoguessr.com</code> and <code>geolead.fun</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Host permissions</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li><code>https://www.geoguessr.com/*</code> – to read your own game data from GeoGuessr daily game pages.</li>
          <li><code>https://www.geolead.fun/*</code> – to inject the import button on the submit page and send your game result to GeoLead.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Extension does not access your browsing activity outside these domains.
    </p>
